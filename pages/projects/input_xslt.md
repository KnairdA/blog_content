# InputXSLT

â€¦is a proof-of-concept implementation of external file access functions for XSLT based on Apache xalan and xerces.

### Why?

Contrary to popular opinion I actually like XSLT as a content transformation language and have built - amongst other things - my personal website on top of it. While I used the XSLT based Symphony CMS for that particular endeavour, the intention behind the experiment contained within this repository is to develop XSLT extensions enabling the development of static site generators using XSLT as both a template and application language.
