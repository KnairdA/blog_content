# Spam Question Filter

â€¦is simple event filter for Symphony CMS to prevent spam by asking the user to calculate a easy math question.

I wrote this [Symphony CMS] extension during the development of a new website for a [local musical society] as I was not satisfied with the solutions available for spam prevention in the [Symphony CMS] context.

The source code is available via [Github] or [cgit] for your convenience.
