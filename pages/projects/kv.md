# kv

â€¦is a simple CLI-accessible key value store written in Chicken-Scheme and using CSV as a backend.

While this sort of program may be useful for storing some commonly required data in a easily accessible fashion its primary purpose for me is to be used as a _Chicken-Scheme_ tryout _platform_.

The MIT licensed source code may be found on [Github] or [cgit].
