# Dotfiles

â€¦is a collection of the configuration files for my essential toolset.

I manage my dotfiles using git and symlink them to their appropriate directories using [GNU stow]. The repository itself is available via [Github] or [cgit].

My toolset currently consists of the following applications:

* fully encrypted [ArchLinux] installation with the [grsec] kernel
* [i3wm] for window management
* [vim] as my text editor of choice
* [pentadactyl] for turning Firefox into a fully keyboard driven browser
* [fish] as my default shell
* [urxvt] as terminal emulator
* [conky] for displaying system information in [i3bar]
* [rofi] as program launcher
* [twmn] for displaying notifications
* [zathura] for displaying documents
