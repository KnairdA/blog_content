# About me

![picture of me in Scotland](/media/me_header.png){: .full .clear}

Hi, my name is Adrian Kummerl√§nder. I am a twenty-one-year-old Software Developer located in southern Germany.

I taught myself programming at the age of 10 and spent the first few years developing software in _Delphi_ and _C#_. After switching from the _Windows_ ecosystem to _Linux_ as my primary operating system I started developing primarily in _XSLT_, _Scheme_ and _C++_ altough I enjoy it a lot to experiment with other languages such as _Scala_ and _Haskell_.

My professional education in software development started with an apprenticeship as a _"computer science expert with subject area software development"_[^1] at [_Sybit_](http://sybit.de) in 2010 which I concluded with distinction in 2013.  
My final project was on _optimizing the development of Adobe Interactive Forms in SAP CRM projects using modularization_. This entailed the development of a custom preprocessor language enabling meta programming in [XFA](http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/xml/index_arch.html) templates on SAP systems.

Since then I work as a part-time developer at _Sybit_ in the _SAP CRM_ area where I mainly develop business printout processes using _ABAP_, _JavaScript_ and _XSLT_ in addition to _SAP WebUI_ development. In addition to that I also occasionally do both voluntary and paid web design work.

Between 2013 and 2015 I studied for my A levels at the _Technische Oberschule_ which I concluded top of my class and with a grade point average of _1.1_.

Currently I am studying mathematics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

Although software development and tickering with my computer systems definitely is a primary occupation of mine both professionally and recreationally, I also enjoy reading _hard science fiction_ books and attending concerts and festivals of _Classical_ and _Metal_ music.

I use this website to document some of my [thoughts and experiences](/archive) concerning software development and various other topics in addition to summarizing some of my [projects](/category/projects).

[^1]: This mouthful really is the official translation of my recognized trade but I for one prefer referring to myself simply as Software Developer
